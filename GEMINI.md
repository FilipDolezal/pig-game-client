# Gemini Project: sp-client

## Project Overview

This project is the client-side implementation of a client-server application for playing the game "Pig". The client is a Java Swing application.

The server-side implementation is located in a separate project. The requirements for the client are located in the `docs` directory.

The project is structured into three main packages:
- `view`: Contains the Swing UI components.
- `controller`: Contains the logic for controlling the UI and handling user input.
- `net`: Contains the networking code for communicating with the server.

## Building and Running with CMake

This project can be built and run using CMake, which provides a cross-platform build process.

### Prerequisites

-   CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
-   Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 14 or higher)

### Build and Run Instructions

1.  **Create a build directory:**
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the build directory:**
    ```sh
    cd build
    ```

3.  **Generate the build system:**
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```

4.  **Build the JAR file:**
    ```sh
    cmake --build . --target jar
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    cmake --build . --target run
    ```

### Cleaning the Build

To remove the files generated by the build process, you can use the `project-clean` target:

```sh
cmake --build . --target project-clean
```

## Development Conventions

The project follows standard Java conventions. The source code is located in `src`.

The application uses the Swing framework for the graphical user interface.
